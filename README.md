# Entity Framework Core

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository contains solutions to tasks related to problems solved during the study of the 'Entity Framework Core' course at SoftUni. The course covers the ORM technology Entity Framework Core (EF Core), which is the standard for ORM in C# and .NET Core applications.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EF Core allows mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model using both "database first" and "code first" approaches. It provides a powerful object-oriented API for database queries and CRUD operations. The course demonstrates best practices in building the database layer of complex systems in C# applications through built-in implementations of the Repository pattern and using the Service Layer. Additionally, it covers import and export to various data formats (JSON, XML).
